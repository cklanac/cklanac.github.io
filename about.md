Hey, I'm Chris Klanac, just another web developer and wantrepreneur with a blog.

This blog is going to journal my experiments and learnings with "Extreme Vendoring". I heard the term somewhere and I'll post the reference if I ever find it. I think the original reference was actually a joke, but the idea resonated with me and jelled with the idea of modular, loosely coupled solutions. You can't get much more modular and loosely coupled than independent, vendored solutions. And it is in-sync with a long-standing business mantra "buy for parity; build for competitive advantage". While I'm not sure where this will lead, I expect the primary competitive advantage will be customer data and the secondary advantage is knowing how to tie together the various systems.

I'm an advocate of the release early and iterative often apprach found in Lean Startup techniques. So this simple blog is going to to practice those ideas. I'm going to post my entries as drafts... some very rough drafts. Basically notes to myself, todo-lists, incomplete and unfinished ideas. Hopefully, I'll edit and improve them as I find the time. You'll also see old posts, some very old which I'll post for posterity's sake.

So with that in mind. You'll see this blog uses the base [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme, which I'd really like to update. But there are more important hurdles, besides if I'm sticking to extreme vendoring approach I should probably just grab a theme.
