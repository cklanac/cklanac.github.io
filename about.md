Hey there, I'm Chris Klanac.

I'm a web developer with 10+ years as team lead and/or software development manager and nearly 20 years experience across the "full-stack" of database, server, browser etc... Of course, way back when Internet connection speeds were still rated in bauds, we simply called it "webmaster".

> Released in 1999!? I wonder if I still have my copy somewhere?

On the side, I'm also a charter boat captain (50 ton masters) and enjoy tinkering on my boat. And on a personal note, I'm married to a wonderful woman Amy Klanac who is a UX Architect. We have a cat, of course.

This blog is journals my experiments and learnings with "Extreme Vendoring". I heard the term somewhere and I'll post the reference if I ever find it. I think the original reference was actually a joke, but the idea resonated with me and jelled with the idea of modular, loosely coupled solutions. You can't get much more modular and loosely coupled than independent, vendored solutions. And it is in-sync with a long-standing business mantra "buy for parity; build for competitive advantage". While I'm not sure where this will lead, I expect the primary competitive advantage will be customer data and the secondary advantage is knowing how to tie together the various systems.

I'm an advocate of the release early and iterative often apprach found in Lean Startup techniques. So this simple blog is going to to practice those ideas. I'm going to post my entries as drafts... some very rough drafts. Basically notes to myself, todo-lists, incomplete and unfinished ideas. Hopefully, I'll edit and improve them as I find the time. You'll also see old posts, some very old which I'll post for posterity's sake.
