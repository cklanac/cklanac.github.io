title: Kitchen-Sink of Skills
---

I few weeks ago I was interviewing developers. One of the candidates asked what I/we look for when hiring. Writing it down ended up to be an interesting exercise. It ended up being a kitchen sink list of developer skills.

> Side read: Here are a couple interesting reads on the topic
